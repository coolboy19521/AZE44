In our working environment we had a whiteboard. We used this whiteboard to note everything we have done, our break times, what we are going to do, and how much time is left before the competition. We also had some notes to support us physchologically. We recently found a picture of our whiteboard from nationaly qualifications. It had these notes that we wanted to share as our philosophy and habits:

- Don't be pessimist (We have written this, because we were having some bad time with our motor driver and it influenced our mental a little bit).
- Don't mind other stuff than the competition when inside the room (We were having some conversations about other stuff at the beginning of our preperations, then we realized it is just waste of our precious time for competition).
- Always plan what you are going to do before coming to the room (We sometimes just went to the working lab and did not know what to do, it took us extra time to think what to do today. To prevent this time waste we added this rule).
- Keep the room clean (We sometimes ate in our lab, which was not a good experience. Considering at some point we did not anywhere to place our robot, we decided to clean our lab daily).
- Don't go to other labs while working (We had a brother team in neighbouring room, and we sometimes went there to chit-chat. It is something normal actually, but we observed that we are spending a lot extra time there, so we just spent time in there only during break times).

Our break times were as follows:
- Afternoon break: `1 PM - 2 PM`.
- Evening break: `5 PM - 6 PM`.

This organized working plan let us be way more productive. We kept this whiteboard technique till the international stage.
