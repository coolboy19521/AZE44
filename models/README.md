1. The  Chassis and General Design

We have a 2-platform design in our robot, which we preferred to be able to modify or repair the robot easily during our test and potentially the competition. It only takes our robot a few seconds to remove its top platform, and we can access the circuitry, sensors, and other internal mechanics so that we can work on them immediately. This saved us so much time when we working on our robot.

The initial design for our chassis was very narrow with angled corners. Although it was sufficient enough for our initial testing, it was very unstable at higher speeds and tended to tip over easily when we added more parts to it. We first analyzed how our mass is distributed and where our center of gravity is, then we decided to completely revamp our design and resize our chassis to `15cm` in width and `28cm` in length. After the modifications, we were able to increase the stability of our robot so that our sensors, which include the camera and LIDAR, are protected from damage caused by vibrations.

We printed the 3D parts with PLA and the Sidewinder X2, along with a nozzle temperature of `210°C` and a heated bed temperature of `60°C`. Where we felt we needed additional strength, for example, in our shafts and our link rods, we chose to work with aluminum. Additionally, the robot weighs 1400 grams.

The earlier versions of robots did not support complex steering or mounting points for sensors and other factors, but with the new design, it has become more modular, and ready for the Ackermann steering mechanism.
